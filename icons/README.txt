Icon Placeholders
==================

This folder should contain the following icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create icons using any image editor or use online icon generators.
The icons should represent network/inspector functionality.

For testing purposes, you can use any PNG images with the correct dimensions.
The extension will work without custom icons (Chrome will use default icons).
